#project guess_game

objective: this is the second version of the guess game.

functionality

          -the program generates a random number which it does not show to the user.
          
          -then it asks the user to guess that number and tells whether to guess higher or lower.

          -this is the second version, so the change that has been done is that the game keeps on going on till the user presses 'q' to quit.
